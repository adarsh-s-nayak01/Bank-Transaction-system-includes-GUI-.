All of the functionalities available while we visit the bank are carried out such as :
1.Creation of the bank account.
2.Depositing the amount.
3.Withdrawl.
4.Transfer of money to another existing bank account.
5.Online payment mode, where just knowing their phone number lets you send the money.
We have specially used 'Cipher' in order to save the password in an csv file, during the creation of the account.

Happy banking ://
